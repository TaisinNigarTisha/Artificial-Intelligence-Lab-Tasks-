# AI Search Algorithms

## 1. Uninformed Search Algorithms (Blind Search)
These algorithms have no additional information about states beyond that provided in the problem definition.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
- **Depth-Limited Search**
- **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**
- **Bidirectional Search**

---

## 2. Informed Search Algorithms (Heuristic Search)
These use problem-specific knowledge (heuristics) to find solutions more efficiently.

- **Best-First Search**
- **A\* Search**
- **Greedy Best-First Search**
- **Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS)**
- **Iterative Deepening A\* (IDA\*)**
- **Simplified Memory-Bounded A\* (SMA\*)**

---

## 3. Local Search Algorithms
These operate using a single current state and move to neighboring states.

- **Hill Climbing**
- **Stochastic Hill Climbing**
- **Simulated Annealing**
- **Local Beam Search**
- **Genetic Algorithms**

## 4. Adversarial Search Algorithms
Used in competitive environments like games.

- **Minimax Algorithm**
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**
- **Expectimax Algorithm**

---

## 5. Online Search Algorithms
These make decisions without complete knowledge of the environment.

- **Online Depth-First Search**
- **Learning Real-Time A\* (LRTA\*)**

## Bonus: Other Specialized Algorithms
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**
- **Iterative Broadening**
- **Fringe Search**
